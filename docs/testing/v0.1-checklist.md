## 1. Authentication

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Sign up with new email | | |
| Magic link email received | | |
| Click link → lands in app (logged in) | | |
| Refresh page → stays logged in | | |
| `/logout` → signs out | | |
| `/login` → can sign back in | | |
| Session persists across tabs | | |

**Known Issue:** Magic link opens in new window (deferred fix)

---

## 2. Basic Chat

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Send message → streaming response | | |
| Response appears word-by-word | | |
| Message saved to history | | |
| Refresh → conversation persists | | |
| Markdown renders: **bold**, `code`, lists | | |
| Code blocks have syntax highlighting | | |
| Long responses don't break layout | | |

---

## 3. Knowledge & Memory

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Tell Voyager a fact: "My dog's name is Max" | | |
| New conversation → ask: "What's my dog's name?" | | |
| Voyager remembers (semantic search working) | | |
| Tell a decision: "We decided to use Stripe" | | |
| Later ask: "What did we decide about payments?" | | |
| Voyager recalls with context | | |

**Test Phrases:**
- "Remember that our API uses REST, not GraphQL"
- "The deadline is March 15th"
- "Jake prefers detailed explanations"

---

## 4. Agentic Retrieval (The Beating Heart)

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Vague query triggers semantic search | | |
| Exact phrase triggers keyword grep | | |
| Graph traversal finds related context | | |
| Multi-strategy chain works | | |

**Test Queries:**
- "What was that thing about pricing?" (vague → semantic)
- "Find where I said '$79'" (exact → keyword)
- "What else relates to the Stripe decision?" (graph)
- "What did we discuss yesterday?" (temporal - may not work yet)

**What to Look For:**
- Does Voyager find the RIGHT information?
- Does it chain strategies (semantic → graph → keyword)?
- Is the response grounded in your actual knowledge?
